# Advanced Machine Learning Projects
Projects from the 252-0535-00L Advanced Machine Learning by Prof. Buhmann at ETH Zürich Fall Semester 2019. Read more about the course here: https://ml2.inf.ethz.ch/courses/aml/

## Tasks

### task0
Simple regression model

### task1
Predict a person’s age from brain image data usign the R2 score. Provided with ~200 anatomical features with missing values, outliers and perturbations.

### task2
Multinominal logistic regression with a highly imbalanced dataset. Solved by using bootstrapping and hard boarder SVM.

### task3
Time-series classification on ECG signal diagnosing heart diseases (ACS vs TTS). Extracting features of the heartbeats by using an autoencoder, as well as features on the general time-series.

### task4
Automatic sleep scoring using EEG/EMG data from 3 people, classifying sleep into deep, REM and awake. Extracting frequency features, balancing the dataset through resampling and validating through leave-one-person-out.
